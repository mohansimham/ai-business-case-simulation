Every decision challenges core executive skills: strategic thinking, risk management, regulatory compliance, and organizational transformation. No theoretical frameworks—just the real challenges that separate successful AI implementations from the 80% that fail.

The CEO just announced a $4M investment in an AI-powered diagnostic platform, calling it \"our moonshot.\"\n\n**The Reality Check:**\nYour team's analysis shows concerning gaps: data quality issues in 60% of patient records, fragmented systems across 12 business units, and no unified data governance framework.\n\n**The Pressure:**\nBoard expectations are sky-high after the CEO's announcement. Marketing has already promised healthcare providers \"revolutionary AI diagnostics\" by Q4.\n\n**The IBM Lesson:**\nYou know IBM Watson Health's $4B failure started exactly like this—overpromising on AI capabilities before solving fundamental data and organizational challenges.\n\n**The Choice:**\nYour recommendation will determine whether this becomes a Watson-style disaster or a foundation for genuine AI transformation.",

The AI will amplify existing data problems, not solve them.\n\nWatson Health failed because IBM tried to leapfrog infrastructure problems with sophisticated AI. The result: systems that couldn't integrate with hospital workflows and recommendations doctors couldn't trust.\n\nAs CDO, your job is sustainable AI success, not temporary executive satisfaction."

You're preventing a Watson Health repeat by tackling the real challenge: organizational readiness.\n\nSuccessful AI deployments follow the 70-20-10 rule: 70% change management and data infrastructure, 20% integration work, 10% algorithm optimization.\n\nBy Phase 1, you'll have unified data governance, cleaned datasets, and stakeholder buy-in. Phase 2's AI will actually work because it has a solid foundation.\n\nThis approach may disappoint executives short-term, but it prevents the 80% AI project failure rate. Walmart's AI transformation succeeded because they spent 2 years building data infrastructure first.\n\nYou're thinking like a leader who understands that sustainable AI requires organizational transformation, not just technology deployment."

My assessment: ${score.percentage}% - ${narrative.tier}

The scenario: "${simulation.title}"

Key areas evaluated:
• Strategic thinking in AI deployment
• Regulatory compliance and risk management  
• Organizational change management
• ROI measurement and business case development

Working through enterprise AI deployment challenges reminded me why successful AI transformation requires balancing technical capabilities with business reality, stakeholder management, and long-term strategic thinking.
